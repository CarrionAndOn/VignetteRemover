# VignetteRemover
A BONELAB mod that lets you toggle the damage vignette.

# Usage
Once you load into a scene, open it's bonemenu category and hit "cache object". You have to click that every time you load into a NEW level. DON'T click it more than once in a SINGLE level.

Then just click the toggle button lol
